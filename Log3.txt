This is the third entry of The CHUCK E. CHEESE Tube Archives:
something went horably wrong! the RSDKv5U decomp is malfunctioning not just on this decomp but also in my Sonic mania game too! every time i open the engine, the keys go haywire!
even when i'm not touching anything in mania, sonic & tails go crazy, the save slots only go one way, etc & this happens every time i extract a fresh new RSDKv5U it preforms the same key glitch
if there's any reason for this, please let me know, as this glitch makes it hard for me to play mania, let alone, work on this decomp
so the game is unfortunately going to be delayed until further notice, i'm sorry
More Updates Soon...
