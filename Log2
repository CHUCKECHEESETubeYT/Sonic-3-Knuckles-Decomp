This is the second entry of The CHUCK E. CHEESE Tube Archives:
i worked on a new sprite for the super sonic transformation, because before it was using a frame from the walk cycle & now it looks alot better, 
oh, also, i renamed certan animations, because, most of the names were too inappropriate for the kids, seriously, what the fuck were they smoking when developing this shit!?
*sigh* regardless, the deed is done, now for the coding side of things, i think ill do the exact same thing they did for sonic mania & make a Game.DLL for sonic 3 & knuckles
I'm not exactly sure how it'll turn out but, we'll see, i'm sure it will be perfect, for now though, i'll need to do some beta testing & see what works & what doesn't
More Updates Soon...
