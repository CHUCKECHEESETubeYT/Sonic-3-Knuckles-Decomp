This will be the first entry of what i'll call "The CHUCK E. CHEESE Tube Archives" where activity & progress updates on the S3&K Decomp will be Recorded & Documented:
I extracted the .RSDK & Modified the source code, deleting any Sonic Mania leftovers i can find, so far so good,
but in order to get the game working in Retro Engine v5 Ultimate however, i'll need to do one of the following:
1. decompile 3&K out of sonic origins (witch is overpriced & i can't download it from anywhere might i add)
2. use code from sonic mania & put that in the rsdk of sonic 3 & knuckles
or
3. remake the code from scratch
so, it's not that simple, but that doesn't mean it's completely hopeless nor pointless, it just means there are ways of decompiling or remaking the source code & i hade an idea, 
you see, i had the idea of using source code from Mania & the sonic & knuckles collection for pc, this way, we won't need Sonic Origins, it's genius! even though i'm just getting started,
i think i can do it, but for now, i'll do everything i can do in making this decomp possable, even though i don't have origins, i still believe it's possable, they say you just need to have hope
i've heard rumors saying it's "impossable" but to me, those people are just pathetic, because they never even tried! that's why i see those people pathetic, so that's why i'm trying,
because i'm not pathetic like them! so now, i'll go ahead modify the source ccode of the .RSDK first, then i'll make the .DLL for the S3&K source for the Retro Engine v5 ultimate decomp to use
for the game itself to run at all, but for now, wish me luck
More Updates Soon...
